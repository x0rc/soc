## Security Operations Center (SOC)

### What is SOC?

The core function of a SOC (Security Operations Center) is to investigate, monitor, prevent, and respond to threats in the cyber realm 24/7 or around the clock.


What is included in the responsibilities for the SOC?

1. **Preparation and Prevention**
	 - Stay informed of the current cybersecurity threats (Twitter and [Feedly](https://feedly.com/i/welcome) can be great resources.)
	 - Work on a [security roadmap](https://www.trellix.com/en-us/security-awareness/cybersecurity.html) to protect the organization, and be ready for the worst-case scenario
	 - Prevention methods include gathering intelligence data on the latest threats, threat actors, and their [TTPs](https://www.optiv.com/explore-optiv-insights/blog/tactics-techniques-and-procedures-ttps-within-cyber-threat-intelligence) [(Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures)](https://www.optiv.com/explore-optiv-insights/blog/tactics-techniques-and-procedures-ttps-within-cyber-threat-intelligence).
2. **Monitoring and Investigation**

	- Learn how to prioritizethe alerts based on their level: Low, Medium, High and Critical.
	- Raise the question: How? When and why?
3. **Response**
	- After the investigation, the SOC team coordinates and takes actions on the compromised hosts, which involves isolating the hosts from the network, terminating the malicious processes, deleting files, and more.
