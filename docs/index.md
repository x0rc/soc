Hi. This is my attempt to publish my notes onto Github Pages.

### SOC Level 1

This are the notes I took while going through SOC Level 1 path @ Tryhackme.com.


### The responsibilities of a Junior Security Analyst or Tier 1 SOC Analyst include the following:

- Monitor and investigate alerts (most of the time, its a 24x7 SOC operations environment)
- Configure and amange security tools
- Develop and implement IDS Signatures
- Escalate the security incidents to the Tier 2 and Team Lead if needed.
