# SOC Level 1

This are the notes I took while going through SOC Level 1 path @ Tryhackme.com.


## The responsibilities of a Junior Security Analyst

-   Monitor and investigate alerts (most of the time, it's a 24x7 SOC operations environment)
-   Configure and manage security tools
-   Develop and implement IDS signatures
-   Escalate the security incidents to the Tier 2 and Team Lead if needed
